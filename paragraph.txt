This project is a basic website for a cloud kitchen business. Its purpose is to showcase the kitchenâ€™s food offerings, provide a menu for customers to view, and share important details like contact information. The site gives customers a quick way to know what the kitchen serves and how to reach out for orders. It is designed as a simple representation of how a cloud kitchen can use a website to connect with customers and create an online presence.
